# HACK-Hardware-Platform

#### This repository contains my implementations of all simulated 
#### hardware components forming the HACK computer, including a CPU, 
#### RAM, and Program Counter, constructed from elementary logic gates.

#### The HardwareSimulator.sh application, as well as the .tst and
#### .cmp files located in the directories numbered 01-05 are necessary
#### to test the functionality of the HDL chip implementations.

## Folder contents:
01 - Contains the chip implementations of Not, And, Mux, DMux, and their multi-bit counterparts.

02 - Contains the chip implementations of arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and its constituent chips.

03a - Contains the chip implementations of single memory bits, 16-bit registers, up to 64-register RAM, and a program counter.

03b - Contains the chip implementations of 512 to 16K-register RAM.

04 - Contains my 'Fill' and 'Mult' program implementations in the HACK assembly language.

05 - Contains the HACK Computer, which integrates the CPU, Program Counter, and Memory into a cohesive unit.
